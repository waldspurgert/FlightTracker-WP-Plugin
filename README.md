# FlightAware Map Plugin

**Author:** Trevor Waldspurger
**Version:** 1.0

## Description

FlightAware Map Plugin is a custom WordPress plugin that integrates with the FlightAware API to display real-time airplane data on a Google Map. The plugin allows users to track airplanes based on their FlightAware username and API key, and it supports customization of the area to track planes.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin as a ZIP file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/trevorwaldspurger/flightaware-map-plugin).

2. In your WordPress admin panel, navigate to "Plugins" > "Add New."

3. Click on the "Upload Plugin" button and select the downloaded ZIP file.

4. Click "Install Now" and then "Activate" the plugin.

5. After activation, navigate to "FlightAware Map" in the WordPress admin sidebar to configure the plugin settings.

## Configuration

1. Go to "FlightAware Map" in the WordPress admin sidebar.

2. Enter your FlightAware API credentials and Google Maps API key.

3. Optionally, customize the latitude and longitude coordinates for the area you want to track planes.

4. Save the settings.

## Usage

To display the FlightAware Map on a page or post, use the `[flightaware_map]` shortcode. The map will automatically show airplanes based on the configured area and your FlightAware username.

Example shortcode: [flightaware_map]

## Troubleshooting

In case of any issues or errors, please check the following:

1. Ensure that the FlightAware API credentials and Google Maps API key are entered correctly in the settings.

2. Check that the FlightAware username and API key are valid and active.
